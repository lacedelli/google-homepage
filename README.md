Google copy page

Pre-project expectations: 

	The main idea is to be able to copy the basic skeleton of the 
	Google homepage? I have no real clue as to the reality of the
	exercise.
	
	I expect the project to be relatively easy, if the case is to 
	exclusively make it LOOK like the homepage, a couple of content
	boxes and some image URL copying should get me there.

Post-project reflections / learning:

	Worked a lot on this, learned the main point of using the web
	browser as a tool to learn the exact style that other websites
	use and how to use it for designing my own styles.
	
	As a matter of fact, I don't really see the point of using any external
	word processor to develop website styles, the only thing that one might
	need --and I say need because I haven't looked into it-- an external
	word processor is to generate the files that have the styles on them.
	
	Having the reference projects from other students in the lesson
	page helped me a lot with shaping my own code at the tail-end
	of the lesson, whenever I felt stumped and found the original 
	Google site to be an incomprehensible mess of classes and tags
	and inline styles, looking over more friendly markup was relaxing
	and reassuring.
	
	I'll be honest, I found this project to be a lot more time
	consuming than I originally thought it would be --that's
	what I get underestimating it--, my solutions
	to each problem were very specific and I'm sure they are 
	rudimentary as all hell, there might be a bunch of refactoring
	to do in order to tone down the amount of rules in the style;
	But, following tip number 1 from the lesson, I'm very explicitly
	not being a perfectionist.
	
	I know the site is bad from an acessibility standpoint, so I'll 
	have to keep in mind the fact that this is NOT the way that things
	should be done going forward, have to put extra attention to 
	accesible HTML for future html projects.
	
	Struggled a lot with the footer, until I remembered that the
	best way to construct nav bars is with lists, rather than
	div boxes.
