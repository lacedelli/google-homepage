Google copy page

Pre-project expectations: 

	The main idea is to be able to copy the basic skeleton of the 
	Google homepage? I have no real clue as to the reality of the
	exercise.
	I expect the project to be relatively easy, if the case is to 
	exclusively make it LOOK like the homepage, a couple of content
	boxes and some image URL copying should get me there.
